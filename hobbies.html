      My hobbies are many and varying, but I will discuss just a few here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy learning about and practicing mathematics. Since I began to teach
      myself calculus freshman year, I have had a penchant for doing math
      because I enjoy it, a fact which perplexes many people who know me. I
      spent the end of freshman year and the following summer learning about the
      fundamentals of calculus, sophomore year deepening my knowledge with a
      much more advanced textbook, and midway through junior year, I discovered
      the Putnam Exam, or more properly, the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical
      Competition. I was stunned by the sheer difficulty of the problems, but
      nonetheless, I worked hard to discover the special secret to each one as I
      tried to solve it. While not always successful in solving the problem, I
      often found the path to the answer, and was always excited by the elegance
      of the method with which the problem could be solved. Now, I have begun to
      once again attempt these sorts of problems, and I hope to expand my
      problem solving abilities in doing so.

      I enjoy trying to learn how to produce music. As discussed on my
      <a href="music.html">music page</a>, I am a fan of psytrance. Now, I am
      try to make it. I have spent hundreds of dollars of gift money on software
      and have received gifts such as studio-grade headphones to contribute to
      the hobby. Ideally, I would like to make it something I can do at a
      professional level, but it will never be something I can dedicate all of
      my time to (something which can be said of any other of my hobbies, to be
      fair).

      Other hobbies I enjoy include theology and political philosophy, but I discuss these on my
      <a href="beliefs.html">beliefs</a> page.
