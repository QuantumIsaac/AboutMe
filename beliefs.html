    <h2>Religion</h2>
    <p>
      I have been a Bible-believing Christian my entire life, coming from an
      originally Reformed background. In recent years, my faith has become very
      important to me, to the point where I attempt to make everything else in
      my life connect back to it, and if I cannot, to analyze whether it is
      something which really should be a part of my life at all. My parents are
      now Calvinistic Dispensationalist Baptists, which was my leaning for a
      long time, until recently. I have been carefully considering Reformed
      theology and Lutheran theology. While most theology has no bearing on
      whether one is saved or not, it does provide important insights on how to
      live rightly, how to worship God, and how to view various aspects of the
      Christian faith. Reformed theology is based off of the works of John
      Calvin, who took the Reformation even further than Martin Luther. Thus it
      is very Calvinistic in nature, in favor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_baptism">paedobaptism</a>,
      and focused on the doctrines of grace. Lutheranism is similar to Calvinism
      in some ways, but is distinguished by some differences between the
      "5 points of Calvinism" and Lutheran positions on the issues which the
      five points address. Lutheranism, in contrast to Reformed theology, holds
      that Christ is physically present during communion, and that baptism is
      a means of God's grace.

    <h2>Politics</h2>
    <p class="cut-bottom">
      I was, at one time someone who would have identified as &quot;conservative&quot;.
      While my views on morality could still be described as such, the word no
      longer aptly describes my political views. I am a libertarian, and in
      particuar, a Christian anarcho-capitalist. This means that I oppose the
      existence of the State for reasons related to my religion and philosophy,
      and that I believe that markets should be free with no State intervention.
      I do not believe that the State should intervene in the affairs of adults
      provided both parties engage in transactions voluntarily. This immediately
      excludes the possibility of taxation, since taxation requires physical
      force. Many object and say &quot;BUT WHO WOULD BUILD THE ROADS?&quot;,
      citing other similar objections related to the military and other public
      services. The simple response is this: private organizations would build
      the roads, funded by voluntary payments rather than taxation. Military
      organizations would be voluntarily in a similar manner. All other services
      provided by government are immoral redistribution schemes which rely on
      theft instead of charity to help the poor, which I claim is radically
      harmful to the poor and far less efficient than private organizations,
      especially churches.

      <br />
      Overall, Christian anarcho-capitalism is anti-war, pro-free-markets,
      anti-State, pro-life, anti-Drug-War, pro-gun, and pro-civil-liberties.
