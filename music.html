      My primary music interest lies in a genre known as psychedelic trance (psytrance). In particular, my favorite
      artist is Astrix, though I also enjoy Ace Venture, Ritmo, Infected Mushroom, Pixel, Alpha Portal, and yet others.
      Infected Mushroom used to be my favorite music group, but once, when reading about them, I found out that they originally
      produced a genre called "psytrance". I looked the word up and saw that Astrix was a prominent influence in the genre as
      well. One late night, I played a couple of his songs on a speaker out of curiosity, and instantly, I loved what I heard.
      I was enchanted by the mysterious atmosphere of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIuEuJvKos4">Deep Jungle Walk</a>
      , the colorful melodies of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3v3R_PlrhI">He.Art</a>, in awe of the musical epic
      that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgjmrA0_MOc&start=120">Shamanic Tales</a>, and moved by the vivid and
      driving beat of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6F-KErk7uE">Valley of Stevie</a>.

      To be honest, there are too many songs which I enjoy to list, so here is a link to a fairly representative playlist:
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/isaac-dorenkamp/sets/psytrance">Psytrance Playlist</a>
      <br />
      The playlist contains mostly the progressive (my favorite) and full-on varieties of psytrance. If you really want to
      check out a more comprehensive guide, you can visit <a href="psytranceguide.com">this page</a>.
