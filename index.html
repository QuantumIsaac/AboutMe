    <p>
      I see myself as a particularly unique individual in my environment. I turn my nose up at
      conformity, stand firm in my beliefs, and enjoy great music. I am very well-rounded when it
      comes to hobbies and talents, and I am diligent about fostering and improving my talents. I
      strongly believe that my faith should impact every facet of my life, and that all my talents
      can be used for the glory of God.
